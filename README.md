# UART_Communication_on_FPGA
UART(UNIVERSAL ASYNCHRONOUS RECEIVER TRANSMITTER ) (UART-PC-FPGA) It is also called as Serial to Parallel and Parallel to Serial Communication .
UART has lot of applications for e.g,Wireless communication ,Bluetooth Modules , used as on board interface in Microcontrollers , GPRS modules as so 
on in varieties of other communication systems too.
Tera term (An Open source emulator was used for receiving the data from fpga &amp; other way around).
